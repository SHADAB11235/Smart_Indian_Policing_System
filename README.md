=> Evidence tampering is well known in legal cases in india.

=> We present the idea of uploading the evidences and FIRs on block chain.

=> Currently Indian Police is using CCTNS (Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems),
   which is a central server based implementation for just lodging FIR.

=> The CCTNS is just in its development phase.

=> Using CCTNS will definitely pose a problem in Future such as server hacking,
   single point of failure and most importantly the risk of D-DOS attack can pose to the problem of permanent loss of data.
   Moreover there is no provision of uploading the evidences in the current system CCTNS.

=> Our Idea uses BlockChain which provides immutability, ensures data integrity in distributed platform.

=> TECHNOLOGIES USED:
	Ethereum BlockChain 
	Solidity in Remix
	IPFS (Inter planetary file system)
	Basic Web Development Tools (HTML,CSS, JavaScript)
 
=> Evidences will be uploaded on IPFS which will generate a Hash Value and that hash value will be stored in Block chain,
   which can later be used to fetch data.
